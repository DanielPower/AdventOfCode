# Advent of Code Solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that takes place in December. It consists of a series of programming puzzles released daily. Participants solve these puzzles using programming languages of their choice, and the difficulty increases as the event progresses.

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code challenges. Each year's solutions are organized by day and programming language.
